# ‚ùì What is this
The HomeLab aims to be a website that works in localhost and that allows you to do various things through its sections:
- **Home** <br>
Allows you to turn off/restart the site, see its system information, execute commands and if enabled, receive information about the ESP32 integration
- **Music Downloader** <br>
Allows you to download music from YouTube and play it on the site
- **Api Tool** <br>
  Allows you to send requests from the site and receive responses
- **Film Download** <br>
  Use Streaming Community API to view cracked movies in Italian
- **Cloud** <br>
  Similar to Google Drive; it allows you to upload files, edit them, rename them and create folders

### ‚Ä¢ Setup ESP32 integration
Required components: 
- ESP32
- DHT11/DHT22 (the circuit was made to use a DHT11)
- LCD 16x2 (I2C)
- 10KŒ© resistor
- Jumper Wires
- (Optional) Bread Board

<br>

First you need to connect the wires like in this circuit:

After that, you need to install MicroPython on the ESP32; I suggest using [this guide](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/esp32-starter-kit/en/latest/micropython/python_start/install_micropython.html).
<br><br>
Add the code present in the `code/ESP32` folder inside the ESP32 files and inside `code/HomeLab` then in the config (`app_config.json`) set `ESP32_integration` as `"True"`
<br><br>
Edit the `boot.py` file located in the `code/ESP32` folder and add the Wi-Fi SSID and password to the dictionary
